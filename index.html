        <p>"Tsoi means more to the young people of our nation than any politician,
          celebrity or writer. This is because Tsoi never lied and never sold out.
          He was and remains himself. It's impossible not to believe him...
          Tsoi is the only rocker who has no difference between his image and his real life, he lived the way he sang...
          Tsoi is the last hero of rock."</p>
